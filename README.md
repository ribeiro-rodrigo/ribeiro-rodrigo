# Rodrigo Ribeiro

### Software Architect • Platform Engineer • AI-Driven Cloud Systems

I design and operate **scalable, reliable, cloud-native platforms** powered by Kubernetes, AWS, and intelligent automation.

My work connects **software architecture, SRE, GitOps, and AI-enabled systems** to build platforms that scale — technically and organizationally.

- Architect production-grade Kubernetes platforms
- Design GitOps-driven delivery pipelines with Argo CD
- Build cloud-native systems on AWS
- Implement reliability engineering practices (SRE)
- Integrate AI capabilities into modern infrastructure
- Create automation-first engineering environments
